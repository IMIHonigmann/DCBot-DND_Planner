<h2> Why (What problem did this solve)? </h2>
<h3> Problem 1 </h3>
<p> Summer vacation at our university just started which caused a problem. When it's summer everyone just wants to go out and do stuff spontaneously. In other words: Scheduling a certain day every week is impossible </p>
<h3> Problem 2 </h3>
<div> Asking everyone to tell if they are available next week got annoying really fast especially considering when we had to do this </div>
EVERY. SINGLE. SUNDAY.

<p />
<h3> Problem 3 </h3>
<p />
<div> The most frustrating part in the end was the following: You ping the people, ask them, collect the names of the people who have time. You look for the day where the most people can come and in the end... </div>
<div> You realize the amount of people who can be there isn't nearly enough to do a session next week </div>
<p> You wanna do this every week? I know i don't </p>

<h2> This is where the DND-Planner comes into play </h2>
<p> It is a bot that schedules a session for the next week which could be any day </p>

<h2> What does it do? </h2>
<h3> 1. Voting </h3>
<p> Every sunday night the bot fetches the time and timezone of berlin to reset the votes and ping everyone who has the DND-Role that they should vote it also shows for which week the session is being planned </p>

<h3> 2. Everytime someone votes the name of the person get's added to the log to signal everyone who can come on a certain day </h3>
<p> This also helped remind people when they forgot to vote because they could instantly see who had voted </p>

<h3> 3. Evaluation </h3>
<p> At the same sunday evening the day with the most votes gets chosen as the winner. When the day with the most amount of votes has enough players who are willing to join the bot pings everyone and tells which day has the most players.

  But when the Bot realizes that the day with the most amount of votes doesn't have nearly enough players to host a session then the scheduling for next week will be cancelled and the bot leaves the choice to the users if they still wan't to host a session </p>

<h2> Final words </h2>
<p> One amazing side effect was that more people wanted to come since they could instantly see if and at which day the DND Session has been planned making them more eager to keep their schedule free for the day to be able to join </p>
<p> The bot helped making the scheduling much easier and is being used on every vacation </p>
